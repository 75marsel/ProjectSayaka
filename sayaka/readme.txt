II. BUGS

The Game is still in deevelopment yet offers promising features

-The HP bar wont refresh after ressurection making a 45% Hp to less than of it.
-Skill 2 Button won't Hide after 3 uses.
-The Boss Dragon is cancelled after it causes the entire game unbeatable!
-Weapons is cancelled random looting on overworld map causes multiple graphical glitches! >.<
-Transparency at Battle is broken

---> SPAWN BUG ---> One walk is equivalent to one random generated number,spamming a movement key in a milleseconds results in one movement
and multiple numbers being generated, resulting in unexpected spawn of enemies

--->OVERWORLD SPRITE ---> The Sprite of character on overworld map minimized as soon as the Oveworld window appears and after the battle.

===============================
III. Development

This Game will be continue to be develop in future, after having an own laptop and better specs of it
some features are cancelled out because of:
1.) lags and freezes
2.) buggy system
3.) overheating
4.) Time
===============================
IV. HOW TO PLAY

The game is simple you just go login and press start, choose a job befiting for you and start walking around the overworld map until an enemy
show up.

the battle system follows the OLD-BATTLE-SYSTEM of Final Fantasy Non-Timer Turn Base system with a mix of math question before you can deal damage.
no answer or wrong answer is equal to 0 damage

Black mage is the strongest for now, Fire can deal damage from 1 to 2 uses with 10+ damage and 27+ at its last use!!!

although the game cannot be beaten as if the boss stage is cancelled.
